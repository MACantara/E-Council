# E-Council — Integrated Student Council Management System Powered by AI

![CI](https://github.com/MACantara/E-Council/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

> An AI-powered central hub for student council operations — managing events, documents, finances, and reports smarter, faster, and with less administrative overhead.

E-Council is a Flask-based web application with a FastAPI backend that digitizes and centralizes the administrative work of a student council — from event planning and concept papers to post-event documentation, financial tracking, board resolutions, and meeting minutes — in a single, authenticated platform with AI-assisted drafting and one-click PDF generation.

It was designed and developed for the **Junior Philippine Computer Society (JPCS) council** and the **College of Computer Studies Student Council (CCS-SC)** at the **University of Perpetual Help System Dalta (UPHSD) — Molino Campus**.

## Background of the Study

The **Junior Philippine Computer Society (JPCS)** council and the **College of Computer Studies Student Council (CCS-SC)** are the two student councils representing the students of the College of Computer Studies at the University of Perpetual Help System Dalta, Molino Campus. They are responsible for handling and organizing events for the enrichment and enjoyment of the students.

The current setup for managing such events revolves around cloud-based tools such as **Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Forms**. For communication within the student councils, **Microsoft Teams** and **Facebook Messenger** are used.

While there are strengths to utilizing these digital services — such as real-time collaboration and centralized file storage — there are notable weaknesses in the current setup:

- **No central hub** for an overview of the student council's activities, financial bank book, data analytics for event evaluation results, and other information that can aid in the council's decision-making.
- **Manual generation of documents** such as concept papers, after-documentation/activity reports, end-of-semester reports, and Society Accomplishment and Compliance (SOAC) reports. These manual processes take significant time while also being prone to human errors, leading to inefficiencies in the operations of the student councils.

To address these issues, this project proposes the development of **E-Council: an Integrated Student Council Management System Powered by AI**. The system is designed as a central hub for all of the operations of the student council. By utilizing the generative capabilities of AI, it aims to improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the student council while reducing the time and administrative workload for student council officers.

## Problem Statement

The manual handling of student council activities by the JPCS and CCS-SC within the College of Computer Studies at the University of Perpetual Help System Dalta, Molino Campus results in significant administrative inefficiencies and an increased potential for human errors. The current reliance on manual processes for managing events, generating reports, and maintaining records creates challenges in accuracy, timeliness, and overall effectiveness. These issues hinder the council's ability to operate efficiently and manage its responsibilities effectively.

This study aims to address these problems by developing a comprehensive, AI-powered student council management system that automates and streamlines these processes, improving efficiency and reducing administrative burdens.

> **Note on architecture:** The application uses a modular Flask blueprint architecture plus a FastAPI REST API in `api/`. `app.py` contains the `create_app` factory for the legacy server-rendered UI, and `api/main.py` contains the FastAPI application. Business logic is split into `routes/` (Flask, deprecated), `api/routers/` (FastAPI), `services/`, `models/`, `repositories/`, `utils/`, and `config/`. The `repositories/` layer is the only layer that touches SQLAlchemy session internals; routes and services use `repo` and `get_repository()` for persistence. The `services/storage/`, `services/email/`, and `services/ai/` layers abstract file uploads, email delivery, and AI generation so the same backends work for both Flask and FastAPI. Legacy `static/css/` files were removed during the Tailwind CSS 4 migration. The React + TypeScript SPA in `frontend/` is the primary UI; the Jinja2 templates in `templates/` are deprecated and will be removed in a later phase after a soak period.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.9 or higher** — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **pip** — bundled with Python 3.4+
3. **A database** — SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL (or any SQLAlchemy-compatible engine). SQLite is used by default, so no external server is required for local development.
4. **A Cloudinary account** — only required if you set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=cloudinary` (default). For local development you can use `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` or `STORAGE_PROVIDER=null`.
5. **A Google Gemini API key** — for AI-assisted document generation
6. **An SMTP mailbox** — for email verification and notifications (the project is configured for Gmail by default; use a Gmail App Password, not your account password)

## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MACantara/E-Council.git
cd E-Council
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS / Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create the MySQL Database

Connect to your MySQL server and create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE `e-council`;
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the provided example file to a local `.env` file (this file is gitignored and should never be committed):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace every placeholder with your own credentials. The example file is organized by service and describes each variable. At minimum, set the following:

| Variable | Required? | How to get it |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Generate locally with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` | Yes | Flask database URI; use a local SQLite path (`sqlite:///e_council.db`) or a MySQL URI (e.g. `mysql+pymysql://user:pass@localhost/e_council`) |
| `FASTAPI_DATABASE_URI` | No | FastAPI database URI; defaults to `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` or `sqlite:///e_council.db` |
| `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER` | Yes | Any email address you control; used as the sender for verification and notification emails |
| `MAIL_USERNAME` / `MAIL_PASSWORD` | Yes for real email | SMTP credentials; for Gmail, use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | No | Email backend: `smtp` (default), `console`, `memory`, `sendgrid`, `mailgun`, or `null` |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` / `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` | No | Required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid` |
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` / `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` / `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL` | No | Required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailgun` |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | No | Object storage backend: `cloudinary` (default), `local`, `memory`, or `null` |
| `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` | No | Local directory for `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` (default: `uploads`) |
| `STORAGE_LOCAL_BASE_URL` | No | URL prefix for `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` (default: `/static/uploads`) |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` / `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Yes for Cloudinary uploads | Create a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and copy the values from the dashboard |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | No | AI backend: `gemini` (default), `openai`, `anthropic`, `local`, or `mock` |
| `GOOGLE_GEMINI_AI_API_KEY` | Yes for `gemini` | Create a key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes for `openai` | Create a key in [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes for `anthropic` | Create a key in [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) |
| `LOCAL_AI_BASE_URL` / `LOCAL_AI_MODEL` | No | Local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. Ollama at `http://localhost:11434/v1`) |
| `API_BASE_URL` | No | Base URL for FastAPI-generated links (default: `http://localhost:8000`) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | No | Base URL for the frontend/React app (default: `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | No | Optional; create a project at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) and paste the DSN |

| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | No | JWT refresh token lifetime in days (default: `7`) |

> **Security:** Never commit your `.env` file. It is listed in `.gitignore`. Use App Passwords for Gmail rather than your account password, and rotate any keys if they have ever been exposed.

> **Running tests:** The CI pipeline runs with a minimal set of environment variables (`SECRET_KEY`, `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`, `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER`). You can run the test suite locally with the same minimal `.env` or with a real `.env` file.

### 6. Initialize the Database Schema

With the `.env` file in place and the virtual environment active, apply the existing Flask-Migrate migrations to create the tables:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

Migrations are versioned in the `migrations/` directory. For a fresh database, this will create the full schema. For an existing database, it will apply any pending migrations.

### 7. Seed Sample Data (Optional)

Populate the database with representative departments, users, events, concept papers, meeting minutes, financial reports, board resolutions, and documentation for local development and demos:

```bash
python seed.py
```

The script is idempotent, so you can run it more than once without creating duplicates. By default, it refuses to run when `FLASK_ENV=production` to avoid overwriting production data. Override this with the `--force` flag if you are absolutely sure:

```bash
python seed.py --force
```

Sample demo accounts are created with the password `DemoPass123!`:

| Username | Email | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| `admin` | `admin@example.com` | Admin |
| `officer` | `officer@example.com` | Student Council Officer |
| `faculty` | `faculty@example.com` | Faculty |
| `staff` | `staff@example.com` | Staff |

## Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

> The application entry point is the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of `app.py`. There is no separate `run.py` file.

The server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` with debug mode enabled. Open your browser to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### FastAPI Backend

The FastAPI backend is in the `api/` package. Start it with Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

The API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Interactive documentation is available at:

- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

API endpoints are grouped under `/api/v1/` (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/api/v1/concept-papers`).

### React + TypeScript Frontend

The SPA is in the `frontend/` directory. It expects the FastAPI backend to be running.

1. Copy the environment example:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Build the production bundle with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Production

For production, use the WSGI entry point with **gunicorn** instead of the Flask development server:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:application
```

The `wsgi.py` file creates the app with the `production` configuration. Adjust the number of workers (`-w`) and bind address (`-b`) to match your deployment environment.

For the FastAPI backend, run Uvicorn with Gunicorn in production:

```bash
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 api.main:app
```

### Background Task Queue

Long-running operations (sending emails, generating PDFs, and AI content) are offloaded to a Celery worker. The worker requires a Redis broker.

1. Set the broker URL:

```bash
export BROKER_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
# Or on Windows (PowerShell):
$env:BROKER_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
```

2. Start the Celery worker:

```bash
celery -A tasks worker -l info
```

For local development without Redis, omit `BROKER_URL`. Tasks will run synchronously as a fallback.

### Building the CSS Bundle

Styles are written with Tailwind CSS v4 and bundled with the Tailwind CLI.

1. Install Node dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the production CSS bundle:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

3. Watch for changes during development:

```bash
npm run watch:css
```

The compiled stylesheet is written to `static/css/output.css`, which is served by the Flask app. The source file is `static/css/input.css`.

## Testing

Tests are written with pytest and configured via `pytest.ini`. The full suite currently passes around **397 tests** with 1 skipped (run `pytest -q` to confirm). From the project root with the virtual environment active:

```bash
pytest
```

The suite includes both the Flask tests in `tests/` and the FastAPI tests in `api/tests/`:

- `tests/conftest.py` — shared Flask test fixtures and app setup
- `tests/test_config.py` — configuration tests
- `tests/test_repositories.py` — repository abstraction integration tests
- `tests/test_routes.py` — route tests
- `tests/test_signup.py` — signup tests
- `tests/test_storage.py` — storage abstraction layer tests (memory, local, factory)
- `tests/test_cloudinary.py` — Cloudinary backend route tests (mocked)
- `tests/test_email.py` — email abstraction layer tests (in-memory backend, factory)
- `tests/test_ai.py` — AI generation route tests (mock provider)
- `tests/services/test_ai_service.py` — AI service and provider abstraction tests
- `tests/test_utils.py` — utility and filter tests
- `tests/test_seeds.py` — idempotent seed script integration tests
- `api/tests/conftest.py` — FastAPI test fixtures (in-memory DB, authenticated client, admin user)
- `api/tests/test_infrastructure.py` — shared FastAPI infrastructure tests
- `api/tests/test_auth.py`, `test_account.py`, `test_admin.py` — FastAPI auth, account, and admin tests
- `api/tests/test_concept_papers.py`, `test_events.py`, `test_meetings.py`, `test_board_resolutions.py`, `test_financial.py`, `test_documentation.py`, `test_dashboard.py` — feature router tests
- `api/tests/test_integration.py` — end-to-end FastAPI integration flow
